Along with XTerm/ANSI/VT100/VT102/VT52 terminal emulations and TELNET/TCP/Serial/Bluetooth connection types, Token2Shell supports comprehensive SSH2 authentication and cryptographic methods.\r\n\r\nToken2Shell also supports Windows 10 Mobile smartphones and ready to run flawlessly in Continuum mode.\r\n\r\nPlease visit http://token2shell.com for more information.\r\n\r\n// USAGE TIPS & NOTES\r\n\r\n- Double-tap toggles the scroll-back mode on and off. Once it's activated, you can drag or swipe the terminal screen to view previous lines (scroll-back mode is automatically triggered by dragging or swiping in full window mode).\r\n- On-screen keyboard is activated when you tap the cursor in Mobile devices.\r\n- In Mobile devices, tapping a session tab and closing its popup menu without selecting any menu (ex. pressing the Back button) also activates the on-screen keyboard.\r\n- Some features are disabled or hidden for Windows 10 Mobile devices based on its available memory (ex. background option may not available on smartphones with less than 2GB of memory).\r\n\r\n// RECENT IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n- \"Clear Scrollback\" is added under the \"Terminal\" menu. If you want to save some previous lines, you can scroll back (SHIFT+UP) first and then select the menu; the text line buffer is cleared up to the currently visible top line.\r\n- ALT+SHIFT+P now takes a snapshot of a terminal window with its title bar and frame border. If you just want the content area, press ALT+P.\r\n- Layout Freezer is added for saving and restoring the layout of opened terminal windows\r\n- New cipher \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\" is added\r\n- TCP Direct connection method now supports TLS 1.2 encryption and can be used for directly connecting to HTTPS servers\r\n- More host key types are added: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-ed25519\r\n- More key exchange algorithms are added: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org, ecdh-sha2-nistp256, ecdh-sha2-nistp384, ecdh-sha2-nistp521, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\r\n- Now supports Bluetooth/RFCOMM communication. This feature can be handy when you're developing or debugging a custom Bluetooth service for IoT devices. For an example of such usage with Windows IoT on Raspberry Pi 2, please visit http://token2shell.com/howto/bluetooth-iot-sample\r\n- Proprietary printing mode (ESC[2016i) for directly previewing and printing a PDF file now supported (http://token2shell.com/howto/local-print)\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts CTRL+SHIFT+C and CTRL+SHIFT+V are added for copy and paste respectively\r\n- CTRL+SHIFT+A keyboard shortcut is added for selecting all buffered terminal lines; Token2Shell first enables its 'Find' text mode and then selects all text.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH20FR1","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"WiFi Commander: 3D Analyze & Monitor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32451.13510798886218304.aa97bf42-daee-4907-9077-95493be18ca1.b12adc26-939c-493b-b9dd-df7906b3ea06","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65023.13510798886218304.a77bcbc4-e7da-4fbf-8433-132d4bb17b92.3cbf181a-6d4d-4822-954d-47c810ef098e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37237.13510798886218304.08a8b861-6c52-45c4-821c-e2f7803722d4.dc4324c1-b0ac-434d-8496-994ac366fcf5","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41189.13510798886218304.ef6fa118-6178-4d43-ac93-574c217c7ca0.3c714c7d-e387-4a0d-9e21-8c08d0f61d64","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"AU$52.45","DisplayPrice":"AU$7.45","Price":7.45,"AverageRating":0.0,"PackageFamilyNames":["50812Studio78k8.WiFiCommander_zayaztrv7k5q0"],"ContentIds":["52b52a4a-2beb-8240-ebf4-727dff12070a"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE AU$45.00","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"✔ Scan the space around you for any Wi-Fi networks  \r\n✔ Original 3D analyzer of channel distributions (touch-friendly)  \r\n✔ Original real time signal level monitoring (touch-friendly)  \r\n✔ Filter, sort and group available networks  \r\n✔ Switch between different networks instantly  \r\n✔ Detailed information about specific Wi-Fi access point:  \r\n  🔸 Vendor name  \r\n  🔸 Security and authentication  \r\n  🔸 MAC address (BSSID)  \r\n   ...  \r\n✔ See all Wi-Fi Direct™ capable devices  \r\n✔ Find less used channel for your own router  \r\n✔ Multiple Wi-Fi adapters support  \r\n✔ Dark and light themes for your preference  \r\n✔ Small app package - just about 4-5 MB  \r\n✔ No Ads  \r\n✔ 30 days FREE trial \r\n\r\n🔶 Discover all Wi-Fi networks around!

Since it's still under development, functions can change (add/remove, FFmpeg DLL may update and change) at any time.  And currently I won't add more languages(hard to maintain).\r\nThis app is just a lite player, I do not write decoder, it uses system(sdk component) and free FFmpeg(unmodifiable, under LGPL) to decode data automatically.  I think it should support system player default formats, but I don't know how many does FFmpeg(WinRT) support. It should support most common formats, but it will not support all formats, just try, if not supported, I can do nothing to it. .

If you liked the first HJ, you'll love Intermediate. (And if you're new to Human Japanese, welcome aboard! Find a full list of content by chapter at www.humanjapanese.com/intermediate.)\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor, Human Japanese Intermediate is built on the idea that the best way to learn and truly comprehend Japanese is to have it explained by someone who speaks your language. Core concepts are explained in a friendly, down-to-earth tone, with frequent comparisons to similar aspects of English. With humor and warmth, it demystifies and illuminates the real nuts-and-bolts of the language--not just vocabulary and canned phrases like many other products.\r\n\r\nExplanations come alive with deeply interwoven interactive example sentences--more than 2600 in total--so that you can immediately see and hear exactly what you're learning.\r\n\r\nStay on track with INGREDIENTS™ example sentence breakdowns. Next to every sentence is an icon that provides an instantaneous, simultaneous lookup of every word in the sentence, even conjugated forms! That means you'll never lose your flow in the middle of an interesting discussion just because you've momentarily forgotten the meaning of a word.\r\n\r\nSolve the chicken-and-egg aspect of kanji with our integrated approach that carefully explains how everything works and then dynamically changes the \"spellings\" of words to either kana, kanji, or kanji with furigana to match what you've learned at that point.\r\n\r\nStay sharp with five different kinds of quizzes that track your history to help you focus on trouble spots.\r\n\r\nWe care deeply about helping you to grow in your understanding of Japanese. Whether you've worked through the original Human Japanese app or have come from a different background, it will be our pleasure and privilege to be your guide on the next stage of your journey.

It is a scientifically-based, easy to use app that you can use to help children and adults of all ages learn to read and spell. \r\n\r\nCreated by reading specialist and speech-language pathologist Dr. Bartek Rajkowski, PhD, Word Builder™ is a fun and intuitive means through which to learn how to use letter-sound patterns to crack the code in the English language. It is designed to be used in parallel with any synthetic phonics program (such as Jolly Phonics or MULTILIT).\r\n\r\nWord Builder™ is perfect for teaching beginning readers, students with reading difficulties and students learning English as a second language. We are confident that the program will quickly become a favourite tool for anybody with an interest in the teaching of reading and spelling! While the app is designed to be able to be used independently, it is a perfect complement to our other apps.\r\n\r\nWHICH SKILLS DOES WORD BUILDER™ HELP WITH?\r\n \r\nTry reading this word: hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia. How did you read it? Research suggests that we read unfamiliar words by converting letter patterns to speech sounds and then mentally joining the sounds to read the word. Competent readers self-teach by successfully decoding new words, while poor letter-sound knowledge and decoding ability are hallmarks of reading difficulties. This code-cracking skill has been shown through decades of research to be crucial in learning to read and spell. Word Builder™ helps students learn the following code-cracking skills found through research to be vital in learning to read and write in English: \r\n\r\nGRAPHEME KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\nRemembering letter-sound relationships. For example, the letter pattern “ay” represents the sound /ay/, like in “play”. \r\n\r\nSEGMENTATION \r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to break words up into individual speech sounds. For example, the word “cat” consists of the sounds /k/, /ae/ and /t/. \r\n\r\nBLENDING\r\n\r\nBeing able to join individual speech sounds together to make words. For example, joining the speech sounds /s/.../p/.../oo/.../n/ makes the word /spoon/.\r\n\r\nDECODING\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to read unfamiliar words by using letter-sound relationships. For example, if a student did not recognise the word “flight” when reading, they could say the speech sounds represented by the letter-sound patterns (/f/../l/../igh/../t/) and mentally join the speech sounds to read the word.\r\n\r\nENCODING\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how to spell unfamiliar words by using letter-sound relationships. For example, if a student did not know how to spell the word /play/, they could break the word up into separate speech sounds and spell the word based on letter-sound patterns (“p..l..ay”). \r\n\r\nREADING AND SPELLING IRREGULAR (TRICKY) WORDS\r\n\r\nAbout 15% of words in English contain unusual or uncommon letter-sound relationships. Many of these words are 'sight words', meaning that they occur frequently in the language. Research suggests that students need to be taught these irregular words explicitly.\r\n\r\nWHICH LETTER-SOUND PATTERNS ARE INCLUDED?\r\n\r\nWord Builder™ includes letter-sound tiles, adjustable visual mnemonics (memory aids), studio-quality sound recordings and animations of mouth movements for the following core letter-sound patterns in English:\r\n\r\n29 Single letter-sounds + \"silent / bossy e\", for example:\r\n\r\n\"a\" like in \"apple\"\r\n\"p\" like in \"pan\"\r\n\"o\" like in \"open\"\r\n\r\n24 vowel letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"igh\" like in \"light\"\r\n\"ee\" like in \"see\"\r\n\"oo\" like in \"spoon\"\r\n\r\n15 consonant letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"sh\" like in \"ship\"\r\n\"th\" like in \"mouth\"\r\n\"dge\" like in \"bridge\"\r\n\r\n14 \"r-controlled\" letter-sound patterns consisting of 2 or more letters, for example:\r\n\r\n\"er\" like in \"her\"\r\n\"ar\" like in \"car\"\r\n\"ore\" like in \"shore\"\r\n\r\n9 word endings, for example:\r\n\r\n\"ing\" like in \"wing\"\r\n\"le\" like in \"little\"\r\n\"ous\" like in \"famous\"\r\n\r\nHOW DO STUDENTS USE WORD BUILDER™ ? \r\n\r\nWord Builder™ gives students an easy way to experiment with making and reading words using the most common letter-sound patterns in English. Students tap on letter-sound patterns to hear the speech sounds they represent. Students can make words by combining these patterns. The student moves his or her finger over the patterns in a word to hear the individual speech sounds in the word and see the letter patterns that represent those speech sounds. An animation of a mouth explicitly teaches students about the relationship between speech and written language while strengthening articulatory awareness skills. Letter-sound patterns can be moved and replaced by dragging and dropping them. They can also be deleted. Students can check to see if words they have made are correctly spelled. \r\n\r\nHOW DO PARENTS, TEACHERS AND READING SPECIALISTS USE WORD BUILDER™ TO HELP STUDENTS? \r\n\r\nYou can use Word Builder™ to build words with letter-sound tiles for the student to read, or you can say a word for the student to build. You can change the selection of letter-sound tiles used in activities so that beginning students can practice with the most basic building blocks of written language while more advanced readers can learn less common patterns. You can also save letter-sound tile sets for later use. An in-built memory-aid system helps students to remember letter-sound relationships. Once students begin to remember these relationships, the memory-aid system may be turned off so that students can begin to remember letter-sound patterns by themselves. \r\n\r\nPlease read our guide to using Word Builder for more information on using the app:\r\nhttp://www.readingdoctor.com.au/word-builder-how-to-use/\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\n\r\nAlthough students enjoy using WordBuilder™, it is a serious teaching tool, not a game! It does not read or spell words for students but helps you to teach students to use letter-sound patterns to read and spell words for themselves. Wordbuilder™ is designed to be used in parallel with any synthetic phonics program.

Just select the length of text that you want to replace, say whatever you want to replace it with, and it's done! \r\n\r\nIn addition to most of vocabulary, Dictation App recognizes several commands that give you more control. Those are: New paragraph, new line, comma, exclamation mark, question mark and semi-colon. It also understands the text emoticons of Smiley, Frownie and Winkie. And this is just the Dictate & Edit screen.\r\n\r\nDictation App is also a handy text-to-speech tool. Any text that you generate or enter into the app, it can narrate back to you in the voice of whichever Cortana language you happen to be using. Each Cortana language comes with a female and male voice personality that sound more natural than synthetic. You can also vary the rate of the narration.\r\n\r\nThe Output screen of Dictation App lets you export the content that you have generated. There are several options. You can save it as a Text File, send it as Email with a file attachment to one or more contacts, send it as SMS with a file attachment to one or more contacts, or Share it with other apps that accept text content. You can also print the first page or save it as a PDF file.\r\n\r\nContent can also be saved as an RTF file that supports formatting and can be opened by Microsoft Word. The RTF editor is equipped with several buttons including Bold, Italic, Underline, Font-size, Font color, Highlight, Hyperlink, Left, Right and Center alignment.\r\n\r\nDictation App converts your spoken words into text in real time, with high accuracy and efficiency. You can correct any misunderstandings easily by selecting and repeating. Generating 500 word articles, 1000 word articles and even essays is an easier process because Writer's Block and analysis paralysis are no longer an issue.\r\n\r\nThis dictation software for Windows 10 has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $2.49. Try it out and see how many cool features it really packs. HasFocus.com listens to customer feedback so if a feature is missing, send us an email and let us know.

Instant Photo Booth comes with 17 built-in photo layouts optimized for both single page and dual strip 4×6 photo booth products, which you can print on your own printer. \r\n\r\nUsers see a live preview with a countdown timer, and the selected photo layout fills in with each shot. After the photo session is complete, users can experiment with image styles, border colors, corners, and backgrounds. Each image can also have a small time stamp. At the end of the process, the user can print and/or share the final product. Instant Photo Booth supports the Windows 8.1 print and sharing charms, as well as direct integration with Facebook and SkyDrive.\r\n\r\nInstant Photo Booth is also highly customizable. Suppose you are going to set up a photo booth as part of a fundraising event, or for your wedding guests. Wouldn’t it be great to customize the look? What if you could also customize the products so they became souvenirs of your event? Or suppose your event has so many people that you need to keep the session time as short as possible. Instant Photo Booth has extensive customization features that will allow you to do all of these things, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all these things, Instant Photo Booth has several optional features that make it comparable to professional photo booth software such as green screen (chroma key), guest book, idle-time slide show, and multiple monitor support.\r\n\r\nThe free version is fully functional, but has image watermarks.\r\n\r\n*USB webcams are not supported by Windows RT.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NVQ1XKBD62B","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"All Video Player HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32090.14394463229893273.e021804b-e3ce-4b4e-b36f-eb0c2bd375e2.0cde8adc-33c2-4a38-9c14-624626fedb28","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32791.14394463229893273.804a3635-0d43-4ff9-ac2e-dd5a032578a9.614c80c0-64cd-4b65-a25e-049a5a85e6d1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.7,"RatingsCount":"18","PackageFamilyNames":["22450.TotalVideoPlayer_0aqw1zw0x2snt"],"ContentIds":["cba64a76-8407-cd52-0173-e3f6ffe0996c","84381c2b-b6b6-07b5-739d-2f0878c68f19"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A player that supports almost all video formats.

The app does not contain any in-app purchases as it did when first released.\r\n\r\nSchool Writing includes 28 individual plain and cursive letters for use in each Australian state - NSW, QLD, SA, VIC & TAS, New Zealand, South Africa, UK. The app also features Zaner-Bloser and D'Nealian styles used for learning handwriting in American schools. \r\n\r\nThis app is certainly a must have for every parent and teacher *****  by mrsnic123 \r\nStudents just love this app. They love the different color choices and the replay button. Definitely seen positive results with students with fine motor difficulties. Congratulations on a great app. \r\n\r\nMust-Have for all schools *****  by Aunty_Vegemite \r\nBrilliant App that is more than just a handwriting App. It can also be used in just about any curriculum area. Incredibly easy to create my own lists of words with pictures and sounds.\r\n\r\nUsing this app, students are able to intuitively trace pre-handwriting shapes, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, words or whiteboard images. School Writing enables hearing and seeing the letters, words and numbers along with customisable associated images and sounds. School Writing allows a student to easily and quickly respond to the lessons by means of written and/or audio recordings. \r\n\r\nSchool Writing as an 'open scaffold' design, can provide far beyond an early educational stage. \r\n\r\nWith the option of tracing accuracy turned on, students are being rewarded with a star depending on their level of accuracy. They are given three attempts before proceeding with learning of next letter or number. \r\n\r\nThe teacher tracing feature enables audio recording for the letter sounds, changing the letter images and recording tracing instructions or individual letter phonetics. \r\n\r\nThe ‘Whiteboard’ section allows a teacher to draw or import images along with unique audio instructions for the purposes of tracing or interaction. Students can trace and record the audio answers. \r\n\r\nThe app enables creation, saving and sharing your own word lessons, profiles and customizations to suit your curriculum, while providing complete control over the lessons' management, the app and the student profiles. \r\n\r\nAs a secure Parent Friendly app, you can put the app into a restricted student mode via a 4 digit secure PIN. When locked, word lessons cannot be created or deleted, profiles cannot be changed and students have no access to any external links.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4N130","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Secret Order 3: Ancient Times (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38123.13510798887460217.703e4358-96c1-45b5-a02d-09082c6cc42f.8287bd0b-c31e-4e28-a931-20a0c6de6db4","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$10.45","Price":10.45,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"24","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.TheSecretOrder3AncientTimesFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["da54f97d-3503-ca2e-fc68-4897806f93fc","fe7e7e45-2bf3-2d3c-5f9d-a5c6beb04f5f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nTravel back in time to find the mythical Kingdom of Aeronhart.

Almost all issues are trivial and can be solved right away. We usually answer within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro is a professional speech-to-text app designed for generating longer pieces of content. Create articles, essays, even ebooks, only using Voice Typing. Never again touch the mouse and keyboard, or touchscreen, when using this speech-to-text software!\r\n\r\nAlthough it is 100% accurate most of the time, its real power lies in the flexible voice commands - referred to as Actions - that let you control all aspects of text presentation. Use them to make any correction or change the presentation of any segment of text.\r\n\r\nSome of the Actions are... Select, Select From/Until, Select Last Word, Select Last Sentence, Select Previous, Select Next, Insert Before, Insert After, Delete, Delete Last Word, Delete Last Sentence, Capitalize, Uppercase, Lowercase, Round Bracket, Double Quote, Single Quote, Hyphenate, Join, Reverse, Acronymize, Spell, and more. You can also create bulleted lists easilty. Usage of Actions and all other features is illustrated by example in video tutorials, accessible from inside the app. There is also a user guide on Actions that can be printed and downloaded.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this description - as is - was voice typed using SpeechToText Pro and Actions.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro will not do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Work without internet.\r\n\r\n2. Produce good results without a high-quality USB microphone. (For more details, see Resources -> Best Results.)\r\n\r\n3. Produce accurate results in the presence of background noise.\r\n\r\n4. Transcribe speeches delivered from a distant source, such as a public speaker.\r\n\r\n5. Convert audio files into text.\r\n\r\n6. Produce audio recordings. This is strictly a speech-to-text app! (Well, it does text-to-speech as well.)\r\n\r\nHere is what SpeechToText Pro does. It:\r\n\r\n1) Converts spoken words into text at the rate of natural speech, and at near-100% accuracy.\r\n\r\n2) Lets you modify existing text, or define the presentation of the text you are pronouncing, through the use of voice commands. Voice commands replace the mouse and keyboard. However, the option to modify text using those methods exists too.\r\n\r\n3) Lets you substitute the predefined voice commands with your own.\r\n\r\n4) Offers support for hotkeys. Simply assign a voice command to a difficult-to-pronounce segment of text. Then pronounce the voice command for the difficult-to-pronounce text to print.\r\n\r\n5) Lets you save text, send it as an email, send it as an SMS message, share it to other apps, upload it to OneDrive, play it back in a synthetic voice, or print it.\r\n\r\n6) Makes it convenient to paraphrase spoken content in Youtube videos.\r\n\r\n7) Lets you do scientific calculator-level calculations with its voice-driven calculator.\r\n\r\n8) Helps you protect your content by defining users. \r\n\r\n9) Lets you produce richly formatted content that can be saved as an RTF file, PDF file, or printed.\r\n\r\n10) Works in English, Mandarin, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese & Spanish.  \r\n\r\nAlthough SpeechToText Pro has a learning curve, it is minimized thanks to its intuitive design, easy-to-read documentation, and the fact that every control (button, switch, menu) throughout the user interface is documented with a tooltip. Every major component of the app has its own user guide. The user guide on Actions can also be saved or printed. The information in the user guides is complemented by video tutorials, accessible through Resources -> Video Tutorials.\r\n\r\nIt is in the user's best interest to learn all the features of SpeechToText Pro so that this Windows 10 speech to text app can be used in its fullest potential.\r\n\r\nSpeechToText Pro has a free 24-hour trial period and then a price of $6.49. Positive reviews help this app continue improving. We also welcome user feedback! Many of the app's present features started out as feature requests. If there is a feature you would like to see implemented, please send an email to admin@hasfocus.com.

Photo Viewer is a very fast, very easy to use viewer that supports psd, dds, tga, webp and other formats.\r\n1.\tPerfect support for gif format. Use space for pause, use enter for full screen mode. Use ctrl + arrows for frame by frame play after the pause. You can save all frames as individual images, or save a gif as a mp4 video.\r\n2.\tGreat support for psd viewing and preview. “.psd” files saved with maximum compatibility from photoshop can be viewed directly. “.ai” files of version 9 or higher can also be viewed directly.\r\n3.\tPerfect solution for the usage of mouse wheel. When the mouse is on an image, the mouse will show as a magnifier and you can adjust magnification with wheel. When the mouse is by the sides of an image, it will show as an arrow and wheel means going to neighboring images.\r\n4.\tFastest magnification experience. A click on an image will result to immediate magnification with no lag at all. Another click on the image or moving away will show the original size.\r\n5.\tVery efficient thumbnails solution that shows below.

Explore, mine resources, craft tools and weapons, make traps and grow plants. Tailor clothes and hunt animals for food and resources. Build a shelter to survive cold nights and share your worlds online. Ride horses, camels or donkeys and herd cattle to protect them from predators. Blast your way through the rock with explosives. Build complex electric devices. Possibilities are infinite in this long-running sandbox survival and construction game series.\r\n \r\nThis is the thirtieth release of Survivalcraft, and it adds a new armor and weapons tier - copper! You can now paint stairs, slab, fences and signs and place electric gates on the floor or ceiling. Wander in dense forests full of tall spruces and fallen logs. Explore bigger caves, but watch out for huge magma chambers underground (15x bigger than 1.28). There are new sound generator sounds for you to use, including hi-fi drums! Check out full list of 70 changes at http://kaalus.wordpress.com/updates-history\r\n \r\nSurvivalcraft brings features you love in the PC version of Minecraft to your mobile device: infinite worlds, caves, logic elements (electricity), weather, boats, ridable animals, explosions, clothes, armor and many more.

And they’re being watched.\r\n\r\n...Who is Agent Ray really working for and will she get what they want?\r\n...What does Junior Agent Reyes know about a 20 year old factory fire that he’s not saying?\r\n...Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again?\r\n...Will Ransome the *Beeping* Clown ever become a decent human being?\r\n...Will aspiring game developer Delores abandon her dreams and stick by her family?\r\n...And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body?\r\n\r\nBy the end of a long, strange night in Thimbleweed Park, all of this will be answered -- and you’ll question everything you thought you knew.\r\n\r\nIn a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least of your problems.\r\n\r\nSupports Xbox Play Anywhere: Yours to play on both Xbox One and Windows 10 PC at no additional cost!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MVV753JKS2H","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Video Editor - Screen to avi and video Editor & Movie Maker","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3612.13856074278697316.c9ab6b1a-6c65-4e05-8f7a-ab8b82c068b5.24ff7830-c355-4547-94f1-fc5beec20017","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13621.13856074278697316.c9ab6b1a-6c65-4e05-8f7a-ab8b82c068b5.2f422671-9f60-46fc-b50f-2a0a890d01f8","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.927.13856074278697316.c9ab6b1a-6c65-4e05-8f7a-ab8b82c068b5.11afa2ee-dfd0-4ef9-866c-5c53f7144c4c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$14.95⁺","Price":14.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["48092WHNC.VideoEditor-ScreentoaviandvideoEditorMov_f0j4wf5e3p8j2"],"ContentIds":["b25965f1-74c6-0647-a7dd-d85593f19538"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"VideoEditor app is a screen, webcam and sketchboard recorder with an integrated editor.

Simply create a path and click on \"Get Elevation\" you will see a nice chart. \r\n\r\nHow does Mt. Everest look like if you cut through the peak, and view it from the side? Try to draw a path from your place to the nearest shoreline. See how slope decline as it approach the ocean? How about investigating the Mariana Trench's steep slope, which goes down to the deepest place on the Earth?\r\n\r\nIn addition, the line of the elevation profile is clickable to indicate corresponding location on the path that you draw.\r\n\r\n[Features]\r\n- Get Elevation from single point\r\n- Get Elevation from a path\r\n- Path will automatically allocate 100 points (really high-definition of elevation profiles!)\r\n- Export raw data in CSV format\r\n- Export the path in KML\r\n- Single-click to export all formats\r\n- Indicator to match the side view and the top view \r\n- Current Location On/Off\r\n- Draggable Waypoints (Adjust the path later)\r\n- State of art intuitive path draw tool\r\n- Universal binary works both Windows Phone 10/ Windows 10 desktop. \r\n- Unlimited Undo / Redo\r\n- Convenient \"Clear All\" button to reset\r\n- Navigation Mode (Lock the screen to browse)\r\n- Search location to zoom the target location quickly\r\n\r\n[Usage]\r\n- As a bike / running route builder: It's convenient to research your bike road profile in order to figure out the schematics of hills. \r\n\r\n- Mobile Learning Experience in the Classroom. If you are teaching Geology or Earth Science, you might have a handout to build a cross-sectional elevation chart from a contour map, and you can let students to verify their answer by themselves. Don't forget, Geo Elevation will provide infinite locations to investigate! The usage is unlimited.\r\n\r\n- Possible flood area investigation: Before storm surge or high tide hit your town, verify locations or road that could be flooded. Draw the path from your house to the nearest shoreline to see the vertical profile.\r\n\r\n- Plan your Walk or Run: If you host a walk or run event, Geo Elevation will help you to find out the slope so that you can map challenging hill in your event. Additionally, it might help you to setup multiple routs depend of the slope.\r\n\r\n- For hiker and mountaineers (send us your review if you used for your activities!)\r\n\r\nAdd your feedback in comments or send us email to info [-at-] objectgraph.com.\r\n\r\nWe would like to hear more user experiences!
